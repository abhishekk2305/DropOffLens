## ðŸŽ¯ Why I Built This, Author

Hi, Iâ€™m Abhishek Dhama â€“ a project management expert pivoting into product roles.  
I built DropOffLens to:

- Solve a **real retention pain point** Iâ€™ve seen across startups
- Show my ability to **think, plan, and ship like a PM**
- Demonstrate ownership from idea â†’ build â†’ delivery â†’ docs

ðŸ§  PM skills Iâ€™ve applied here:
- Problem validation
- MVP scoping
- User-centric documentation
- Technical collaboration with AI agents
- Product thinking, not just feature thinking
